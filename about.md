## About

Welcome to akll.io. This is the personal website of me, Andreas Keller Leth Laursen. I'm an economist with a huge interest in all sorts of machine learning, data, statistics and programming.

Having finished [university](http://econ.au.dk/), and started my [first](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en/about_danmarks_nationalbank/organisation/Pages/Statistics.aspx) (post academia) and [second](http://www2.deloitte.com/dk/da/services/technology.html?icid=bottom_technology) full-time job, the site was created as a place to document my various side projects and activities. Thus akll.io is not a blog in the traditional sense, but simply a place for me to log what I create, while working on my various hobbies. Hence the title - **Econ and Machine Learning**. What I will be doing is logging my work on the web, i.e. writing a weblog. I love learning new things and the site is also meant to inspire myself to learn more about the things that interest me.

Having dappled with web application development in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) through the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application framework, I also wanted to use the creation of the site as a learning opportunity. That is to increase my knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and preferably a more general web framework. I ended up choosing [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as the web frame work. The general process and the thoughts that went into writing the site is described more in the [first post](http://www.akll.io/2016/2/19/start-something/).

Three years down the line, I'm no longer dedicating the time to write anymore. This is primarily due to being quite fulfilled  at my current job - Where I work with developing and implementing cutting edge machine learning solutions. While learning new things every day, most of  my work are unfortunately  proprietary and cannot be shared. I've created a new [tab](/projects), where I describe  some of the projects I've been working on, with as much detail I can give.

No longer writing actively also means that it's not as fun to maintain my own CMS for the underlying site. Thus I decided to retire it. It was a fun learning opportunity at the time, when I was quite bored and wanted to learn more indepth Python programming (great investment - Python is all I use these days). Given the small size  of the site, it makes sense to use a static site setup rather than managing databses. The migrated site is now running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) with everything generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (which is awesome!)
