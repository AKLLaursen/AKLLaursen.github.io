# Projects
Here's an overview of the projects I've worked on at Deloitte Consulting

- Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Anti-money laundering (AML) modelling on graph data.
- Predicting adverse gambling behavior using ensemble models on transactional data.
- Quality inspection on a production line using traditional CNNs with images as input.
- Predicting relevant spare parts and man hours for claims based on inventory data of historic claims using ensemble models.
- Deep learning models to improve the quality of scanned documents using auto encoders and extracting information from documents using object detection models and Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for interpretation.
- Identifying and implementing a machine learning platform. Formulating best practices for development.
- Classifying a large number of documents using topic models and neural network methods such as doc2vec. Processing said documents using Spark on Hadoop.
